Staffing and recruiting firms are not what they used to be. Not that long ago, many employers viewed temporary help exclusively as a tool for filling last minute gaps in their workforce (i.e., staff absences, vacation, extended leave, etc.), typically for entry-level positions. Not anymore though.

As the global demand for talent has increased, staffing agencies have become a vital part of a company’s overall talent acquisition strategies.

Today, staffing firms provide high caliber talent, filling temporary, contract to hire, and full-time positions across all levels and departments of an organization. When coupled with an effective overall talent acquisition strategy, partnering with a staffing firm can greatly enhance an organization’s productivity and profitability. 

In this post we debunk 5 myths about working with staffing agencies and recruiting firms.


## Myth #1: "They're too expensive."

Fact: Partnering with staffing agencies and recruiting firms should save your organization money. By allowing you to better match your workforce to your workload, staffing firms can dramatically reduce labor costs.

They can also help you eliminate overtime expenses, reduce benefits cost, and simplify HR administration. And when you need to hire a full-time employee, you can leverage a staffing firm's recruiting expertise and economies of scale to quickly and cost-effectively access the talented candidates you need.

## Myth #2: "All temporary employees are entry level."

Fact: Temporary employees now work in virtually every industry and increasingly include highly skilled professionals. In fact, the fastest growing segments of the staffing industry are for professional positions, including: healthcare, information technology, accounting/finance, creative/marketing, HR and executive-level professionals. Staffing firms can provide on-demand expertise to tackle mission-critical projects--for a lot less cost than hiring a consultant.


## Myth #3: "You can't hire a good employee through a staffing firm."

Fact: Staffing firms use rigorous screening, interviewing, skills testing and background / reference check processes to ensure the quality of talent they supply. And unlike an individual you recruit on your own, a staffing service's candidate comes with a guarantee.|

## Myth #4: "Staffing agencies only provide 'temps.'"

Fact: Today's staffing suppliers offer a wide variety of services that can be customized to suit your workforce needs, including: temporary help, direct hire, temp-to-hire, contract staffing and payroll services. Many staffing firms also provide more strategic workforce management solutions such as on site supervision and vendor management systems.|


## Myth #5: "Temps are only good for 'fill-ins."

Fact: Beyond filling in for vacations or illnesses, employers regularly use temporary and contract employees to provide extra support during busy times, staff special short-term projects, access specialized talent and evaluate talent for permanent positions.

These are just a few examples of the many ways employers are using temporary staffing as a strategic business tool. To learn more, contact Sparks Group today.
